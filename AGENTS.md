# Repository instructions

## Development servers

- Always use Portly (`portly ...`) to start, stop, restart, inspect, or keep local development servers running.
- Start with `portly status --json`. Reuse a healthy managed server; if an in-scope server is running outside Portly, register it and use `portly take-over <project/server> --json`.
- Never launch persistent development servers directly, in the background, or through another supervisor.
